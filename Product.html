Anshuman Pharma has built a portfolio of patent protected speciality medicines for global markets.
Over the years, we have nurtured this evolving business through increased focus and investments.
The key segments we are targeting are dermatology, ophthalmology and oncology. Our focus is on 
improving patient outcomes either by addressing unmet medical needs or by enhancing patient 
convenience through differentiated dosage forms. Our initiatives in this segment cover the entire
value chain, from in-licensing early-to-late stage clinical candidates, as well as getting access
to on-market patented products. Today, we are among the leading branded companies in the US with 
several speciality products launched in the country.

We began producing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in 1995 as a vital input in the
manufacture of complex formulations to facilitate vertical integration. Today, our list of 
APIs exceeds 300 which is used in house as well as marketed to customers in over 60 countries.
We manufacture APIs in 14 manufacturing facilities located in India, Hungary, US, Israel and 
Australia. Our product list includes generics and complex APIs that require isolated manufacturing
areas like anti-cancers, peptides, steroids, sex hormones and controlled substances, including 
poppy-derived opiate raw materials that are primarily used in the manufacture of analgesics, sold
as both Narcotic Raw Materials(NRM) and APIs. We offer bulk actives, intermediates and services for
custom synthesis.
